At the same time an attack had taking down the connection to those other services which was causing our requests to fail and build up on a dead letter queue. Now these requests weren’t broken per se, they were just victim to a one off transient error. The data within the request was perfectly valid and could still be replayed.</p>\n<p>Because of that event I wanted to build something that could be turned on at a moments notice and be used to replay items in the dead letter queue, albeit temporarily.</p>\n<p>Lambda seemed to be a good fit for this. We could specify a queue to trigger the lambda against and a queue to replay those items to.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AWS SQS Dead Letter Replay Lambda","date":"March 17, 2019","description":"Ever needed to replay items in your dead letter queue?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/aws-sqs-dead-letter-replay-lambda/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-i-like-to-structure-and-build-go-services/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I like to Structure and Build Go Services"}},"next":null}}
